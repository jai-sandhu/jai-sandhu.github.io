# Hosting a resume on Github Pages

## Intro 



If you have ever wanted to learn how to host a page on the web. GitHub Pages is a great place to start. Its simple, convenient, and completely free. So you won't need to sacrafice a day without coffee to host a website. you will be using andrew Etter's book _Modern Technical Writing_ as a side project. It gives great examples and guidelines to follow from hosting online content to why you should do it.  

To get started, you need to get your self a Github account. If you haven't had any experience with GitHub, its known as a code hosting platform that uses a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). DVCS's is a version control type where everything done to the code is saved. It gives you the full history of whats happened to the each file. It also makes it so all changes are mirrored on every developers computer thats part of the project. Etter explains "The basics are that DVCS have better performance, allow for offline work, and are superior for concurrent work
on the same file."  

All you need to know for now is that this is the website you will be using to host your resume. Specifically using a feature called GitHub pages. More on this later.  

There are many different mediums to use GitHub, I will be giving all the steps in the website version. You can follow along or use your own preferred method. After you have created your account, you need to create a repository. This is where you will be doing all of your work, think of it as the main folder in which you will be entering all your content into. To create a repository, you simply need to click the green "New" button located on the top left. This will take you to a new page where you enter your repositories name. It is inportant that you format your repositories name, or else you will not be able to use GitHub Pages. Use the format _username. github.io_. Before you click create repository at the bottom, I recommend that you checkmark the option to create a README file.  

Now that you have the repository set up, you will create an index.md file. This is where all of the content for your resume will reside. Now that everything is set up, we can get to the nitty gritty. First you need to make your resume using a lightweight markup language.
